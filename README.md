# PySpark-Data-Transformation-and-Masking-for-Salesforce-Account-Data
This PySpark script transforms Salesforce account data: numeric fields are incremented, strings uppercased and tagged with column names, dates formatted, and sensitive fields masked. The result is saved as a temp view transformed_account for querying.
